# Chat Pruner

Chat Pruner is a GM-only tool for cleaning up your game’s chat log.  
It adds a single button to the chat sidebar so the Game Master can quickly open a window and manage old messages.

## What it does

- Shows the **last 200 messages** in your chat log.  
- Lets you **select multiple messages** and delete them all at once.  
- Lets you pick one message and **delete everything after it** in the log.  
- Respects permissions — only the GM can use this module.

## How to use it

1. **Enable the module** in *Manage Modules* once it’s installed.  
2. As the GM, go to the **Chat Log** in Foundry.  
3. Under the message input box, you’ll see a new button:  
   - **Manage Chat** — opens the Chat Pruner window.  
4. In the Chat Pruner window:  
   - Use the checkboxes to select messages and click **Delete Selected**.  
   - Use the radio button next to a message to set it as an “anchor” and click **Delete After Anchor** to remove all newer messages.  
   - Click **About** (inside the window) to see a short description of the module.  
5. Confirm when asked — deleted messages are gone for good.

## Tips

- Only the last 200 messages are shown at once.  
- Clicking anywhere on a row will toggle its checkbox.  
- Use the “Select All” box at the top to quickly select every deletable message.  
- If you don’t see the Manage Chat button, make sure you’re the GM and the module is enabled.
